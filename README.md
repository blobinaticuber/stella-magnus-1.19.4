# stella-magnus-1.19.4

Stella Magnus is an upcoming Minecraft mod that attempts to greatly extend Minecraft's progression system by introducing out-of-this-world aspects to the game.

Minecraft's progression is pretty boring. You get Iron gear, Diamond Gear, do enchanting, and then upgrade to Netherite. While these tiers of armor and weapons do make you stronger, it's absolutely nothing in comparison to games like Terraria, Factorio, and more. 
### Future Plans:
- Travel to planets, moons, and asteroids throughout the galaxy
- Each planet you unlock adds more lore and progression
- Become an all-powerful spatial being ðŸ’€

#### Inspired by:
- Galacticraft
- Ad Astra
- Terraria
- Star Trek
- Star Wars
- Stargate
